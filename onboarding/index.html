                    <h3>Identify Flight Risks Before They Start Job Hunting</h3>
                    <p>RIPLLL tracks the behaviors that predict turnover: skill development stagnation, declining engagement with growth opportunities, and reduced participation in career pathing activities. Real-time engagement scoring flags at-risk employees 60-90 days before they resign—giving you time to intervene with reskilling opportunities, promotions, or lateral moves.</p>
                    <p class="stat">Companies using predictive engagement data reduce voluntary turnover by 25-40%.</p>

                    <p>RIPLLL gamifies career development with personalized reskilling paths, skill progression tracking, and clear milestones to promotion. Employees see exactly what skills they need, track their progress in real-time, and earn recognition for growth—making internal mobility more attractive than external offers.</p>
                    <p class="stat">Employees with clear career paths are 3.5x more likely to stay for 3+ years</p>

Turn your L&D investment into documented behavioral change that proves employees are actually growing, not just clicking through courses.</p>
                    <p class="stat">Verified skill application increases internal promotion rates by 35% vs. self-reported training.</p>

RIPLLL provides executive dashboards showing exactly which career development investments drive retention vs. which are wasted spend. Prove that investing in existing talent is 2-3x cheaper than replacing them.</p>
                    <p class="stat">Replacing an employee costs 1.5-2x their annual salary. Retaining them through reskilling costs 10-20% of that.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-container">
                <!-- FAQ 1 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How is RIPLLL different from our existing LMS or HRIS?</h3>
                    <p>Your LMS delivers training content and tracks completion. Your HRIS manages employee records and workflows. RIPLLL fills the critical gap between them: tracking whether new hires actually apply what they learned and integrate into your culture.</p>
                    <p>Think of it as the missing behavioral layer between training delivery and performance management. RIPLLL doesn't replace your existing systems—it integrates with them to provide visibility into the behaviors that predict retention.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 2 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What does implementation look like? How long until we see results?</h3>
                    <p>Implementation takes 2-4 weeks and includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Week 1: Discovery and milestone design (map your critical success behaviors)</li>
                        <li>Week 2: System integration with your HRIS/LMS (API connections, SSO setup)</li>
                        <li>Week 3: Manager training and pilot group launch (20-50 new hires)</li>
                        <li>Week 4: Full rollout and optimization</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You'll see engagement data immediately. Predictive turnover insights emerge within 60-90 days as behavioral patterns develop. Measurable turnover reduction typically shows within 6 months.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 3 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much time does this add to managers' workloads?</h3>
                    <p>RIPLLL actually reduces manager workload. Instead of manually tracking onboarding progress via spreadsheets and check-ins, managers receive automated alerts when critical milestones are missed.</p>
                    <p>Average time investment: 2-3 minutes per new hire per week to verify photo/video milestones and provide feedback. This replaces the 2-4 hours per month most managers spend on manual onboarding tracking.</p>
                    <p>Managers appreciate the early warning system—it's much easier to course-correct a new hire in week 3 than to conduct an exit interview in week 12.</p>

                <!-- FAQ 4 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if new hires don't engage with the platform?</h3>
                    <p>Non-engagement is valuable data. A new hire who isn't completing milestones within the first two weeks is statistically likely to quit within 90 days. RIPLLL's alert system flags this early, allowing managers to intervene before it's too late.</p>
                    <p>That said, our gamification engine drives 70%+ engagement rates in pilot programs. Most new hires engage because the platform is mobile-first, easy to use, and built around motivational psychology (not corporate drudgery).</p>
                    <p>When engagement does drop, our system helps managers identify root causes: Is it a skill gap? Cultural misfit? Poor manager relationship? Remote isolation? You get actionable insights, not just a red flag.</p>

                <!-- FAQ 5 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do you calculate ROI? What results should we expect?</h3>
                    <p>We calculate ROI using three factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Turnover Reduction:</strong> If you hire 400 people annually with 20% first-90-day attrition (80 quits) at $50K replacement cost each, reducing turnover by just 10% saves $400K annually.</li>
                        <li><strong>L&D Productivity:</strong> Automated tracking and predictive insights save L&D teams 10-15 hours per week vs. manual systems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Time-to-Productivity:</strong> New hires who complete behavioral milestones reach full productivity 20-30% faster than those who just check boxes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Typical ROI: 5-10x in year one for organizations hiring 500+ people annually. Payback period: 1-3 months.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- FAQ 6 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is this just for large enterprises, or can mid-sized companies benefit?</h3>
                    <p>RIPLLL is designed for organizations hiring 200+ people annually, regardless of total company size. Our sweet spot is 500-5,000 employees, but we work with customers ranging from 800 to 50,000 employees.</p>
                    <p>If you're experiencing first-90-day turnover, struggling to prove L&D ROI, or managing remote/hybrid onboarding at scale, RIPLLL delivers value. We offer pricing that scales with your hiring volume.</p>

                <!-- FAQ 7 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What about data privacy and security? Who owns the data?</h3>
                    <p>You own all your data. Period. RIPLLL is fully compliant with HIPAA, SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, and CCPA. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We undergo annual third-party security audits and support on-premise or private cloud deployment for enterprise customers with strict data residency requirements.</p>
